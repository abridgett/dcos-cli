Command line utility for the Mesosphere Datacenter Operating
System (DCOS)

'dcos help' lists all available subcommands. See 'dcos <command> --help'
to read about a specific subcommand.

Usage:
    dcos [options] [<command>] [<args>...]

Options:
    -h, --help                 Show this screen.
    --version                  Show version.
    --log-level=<log-level>    Print log messages to stderr at or above this
                               level. Valid values, ordered from most verbose
                               to least verbose, are debug, info, warning,
                               error, and critical. For example, setting the
                               option to `warning` prints warning, error, and
                               critical messages to stderr. Note: This does not
                               affect the output sent to stdout.

    --debug                    Send further debug messages to stdout.

Environment Variables:
    DCOS_LOG_LEVEL             Specifies that messages should be printed to
                               stderr at or above this level. See the
                               --log-level option for details.

    DCOS_CONFIG                Specifies the location of the DCOS configuration
                               file. This variable is set at install time and
                               stores the configuration file at
                               ~/.dcos/dcos.toml on Unix systems or
                               C:\Users\<username>\.dcos\dcos.toml on most
                               Windows systems. After installation, this
                               variable is not set by default.

    DCOS_DEBUG                 If set to `true`, send further debug messages to
                               stdout. Equivalent to the --debug option.

      DCOS_SSL_VERIFY          Sets whether to verify SSL certificates for
                               HTTPS, or sets the path to the SSL certificates.
                               Default value is true. Equivalent to setting the
                               core.ssl_config option in the DCOS configuration
                               file.
